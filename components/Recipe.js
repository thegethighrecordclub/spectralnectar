      <p>This is David's Coriander Tofu dish!</p>
      <p>
        {"Hello, and thanks for wanting to make my simple rice and tofu dish! I'd say this recipe is probably ideal for two people, but you can easily adjust the amounts of everything if you're cooking for more. Also, please feel free to omit or add any ingredients. I've never actually written this down or thought of it as a recipe before, so I think it would be wise to use a \"to taste\" approach for the seasonings."}
        {"INGREDIENTS\n"}
        {"1 cup jasmine rice\n"}
        {"1 tablespoon oil (I like grapeseed oil since it's mostly flavorless and has a relatively high smoke point, but you can use any kind you'd like. Clarified butter or ghee is great if you'd like some extra richness.)\n"}
        {"4 cloves garlic, minced\n"}
        {"2 tablespoons ginger, minced \n"}
        {"1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n"}
        {"1 tablespoon brown sugar\n"}
        {"1 teaspoon coriander powder\n"}
        {"1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or probably any other kind of vinegar)\n"}
        {"3 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari sauce) \n"}
        {"1 teaspoon fish sauce\n"}
        {"1 yellow onion (a medium/large one)\n"}
        {"1 jalapeño\n"}
        {"1 head cauliflower\n"}
        {"1 red bell pepper\n"}
        {"1 package extra firm tofu (cubed)\n"}
        {"garnish: cilantro and lime wedges\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"INSTRUCTIONS\n"}
        {"Step 1: Start cooking the jasmine rice. If you don't have a rice cooker, I bet you know how to do it on the stove.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 2: Chop the onion, jalapeño, and red pepper into thin, longish pieces. Cut the cauliflower into small florets. (If you'd like to use chicken or some other kind of meat instead of tofu, I'd recommend cooking that first, cutting it into smallish pieces, and setting it aside to add in later.)\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 3: Place large skillet or wok and over medium high heat. Once it's hot, add the oil, and when you think it's hot enough to make a sizzling sound when you put the onions in, put the onions in.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 4: Sauté the onions for maybe five minutes, stirring just enough to keep them from burning, then add the garlic, ginger, red bell pepper, red pepper flakes, and cauliflower. Sauté for about five more minutes (or until everything looks like it's almost ready to be done cooking), stirring frequently.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 5: Turn the temperature down to medium low and wait for everything to cool down. Sometimes I remove the skillet for a minute to speed up the cool-down process. The reason I do this is that if you add the liquids when it's too hot they can burn to the bottom of the skillet in an unsavory way. Sometimes it tastes good when it gets a little burned though.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 6: Add the brown sugar, coriander powder, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and tofu (or other meat) and stir it all up! If it seems like it might not be cooking right, maybe increase the heat to medium and cook for another few minutes with a lot of stirring. This is the part where I'm not especially sure about the amounts, so keep adding more of everything until it tastes right to you. If some other spices in the rack catch your eye in an intriguing way, throw a pinch or two in. That's what I always do.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 7: Chop up some cilantro and lime wedges and put those on a little plate for everyone, and put the rice in a big bowl. I like to make sure there's some hot sauce and soy sauce on the table too.\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"Step 8: Enjoy!\n"}
